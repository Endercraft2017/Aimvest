# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
This plan outlines the steps to dynamically populate the project section on the homepage, create a new page to display all projects with details, and add animations and scrolling functionality to the project showcase.

[Types]
No new data types will be introduced. The project information will be handled as objects within JavaScript.

[Files]

- **New Files:**
  - `Frontend/projects.html`: A new HTML file to display all projects.
  - `Frontend/projects.css`: A new CSS file for styling the projects page.
  - `Frontend/projects.js`: A new JavaScript file for the projects page functionality.
- **Modified Files:**
  - `Frontend/index.html`: The project container will be modified to be populated dynamically. A "View All" button will be added.
  - `Frontend/style.css`: Styles will be added for the project container, cards, animations, and the "View All" button.
  - `Frontend/script.js`: JavaScript will be added to fetch project data and populate the project container on the homepage.

[Functions]

- **New Functions:**
  - `getProjectData()` in `Frontend/script.js`: This function will fetch the project data from the `resources/projects` directory.
  - `populateProjects()` in `Frontend/script.js`: This function will dynamically create and insert project cards into the project container on the homepage.
  - `populateAllProjects()` in `Frontend/projects.js`: This function will dynamically create and insert project cards into the projects page.

[Classes]
No new classes will be created.

[Dependencies]
There are no new dependencies to be added.

[Testing]

- Manual testing will be performed to ensure:
  - The project container on the homepage is populated correctly.
  - The scrolling functionality works as expected.
  - The "View All" button navigates to the projects page.
  - The projects page displays all projects with their details.
  - The animations and styling are applied correctly.

[Implementation Order]

1. **Create the `projects.html` file:** This file will contain the basic structure for the projects page.
2. **Create the `projects.css` file:** This file will contain the styles for the projects page.
3. **Create the `projects.js` file:** This file will contain the JavaScript for the projects page.
4. **Modify `Frontend/index.html`:** Update the project container and add the "View All" button.
5. **Modify `Frontend/style.css`:** Add styles for the project container, cards, animations, and the "View All" button.
6. **Modify `Frontend/script.js`:** Add the `getProjectData()` and `populateProjects()` functions to dynamically populate the project container on the homepage.
